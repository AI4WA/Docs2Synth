# Docs2Synth

Docs2Synth is a Python package aimed at helping you convertt, synthesise and train a retriever for your document datasets.

The workflow typically involves:

- Document processing
  - MinerU or Other OCR methods
- Agent based QA generation
  - QA Pair generation
    - For now, given content, generate a question and answer
    - Later we can extend to multiple page contexts in a single QA pair.
  - Two step verification
    - Meaningful verifier
    - Correctness checker
  - Human judgement
    - Human quickly annotate keep/discard
- Retriever training
  - Train LayoutLMv3 as a retriever
  - Extend to bert, etc
- RAG Path
  - Other out-of-box retriever strageties without training
- Framework pipeline
  - Combine all the above steps into a single pipeline and control flow based on parameters
  - Benchmarking
    - Retrieveral Hit@K Performance
    - End to end latency metrics
