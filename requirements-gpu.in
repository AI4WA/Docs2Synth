# GPU-enabled PyTorch installation (CUDA 11.8)
# This file defines the top-level PyTorch dependencies for GPU systems
# Note: Install directly with --extra-index-url, don't compile to .txt
# Reason: NVIDIA CUDA dependencies are platform-specific and managed by PyTorch

# For Docker/production, use in Dockerfile:
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
